## About
Snse is a simple app to track your mood, capture your thoughts, track your water consumption, or be your color palette.

How often have you thought, "I should journal more." but never get around to it; or when you do, have trouble articulating your thoughts into words.
I wanted a way to capture some of the less articulate sentiments.
 * **How are you feeling?:** üòû üòê üòä 
   - No value judgement for any of the options. No, "What's wrong", or "Why aren't you happy?". 
   - No explanation needed; you own your emotions and shouldn't have to answer to or for them.
 * **0 - 100:** This is a slider that _doesn't_ show your selected value, on purpose. 
   - We are constantly innundated by micro-stresses, pressures to conform or be perfect. We rarely feel precisely a number, so there isn't any value in trying to record one. Feelings have rough edges, this is to aim at that blurry edge.
 * **Color?:** Sometimes a season is tinted with a hue, or a certain shade really stands out to you. 
   - For me, Summer feels blue, green, and bright yellow. Is a specific color speaking to you, pick it, and save it for later.
   - Color is the only one that has an additional affect. When you select a color the "tint" of all the UI elements is set to your color. (Sometimes this makes interacting with the rest of the form difficult, so you may want to set it last if you are feeling a particularly bright color.)
 * **Have you recently drunk water?:** Water consumption has a huge impact on our mood ([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963107)). Highlighting the correlation of mood vs hydration is something I wanted to call out. 
   - Adding that as its own entry field was done with intent to influence you to drink more water.
   - This was additionally inspired by _"Hampton's Helpful Hint #1"_ from the [Suicidie Buddies podcast](https://starburns.audio/podcasts/suicide-buddies/).
 * **Elaborate?"** A traditional journal entry. Write what you want, it will be captured.
 
**None of the values are required to save a sentiment.** Sometimes just showing up is all that needs to be said.
